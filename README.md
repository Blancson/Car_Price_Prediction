# Car Prediction Analysis using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a car prediction analysis using linear regression. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. In this project, we will use linear regression to predict the price of cars based on various features.

## Dataset

We will be using a dataset of car attributes and their corresponding prices. The dataset is stored in the `data` directory and is named `data.csv`. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Make`: The name of the car.
- `Year`: The year the car was manufactured.
- `Model`: The model of the car.
- `Engine_Fuel_Type`: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- `Engine_HP`: The Engine HorsePower.
- `Engine_Cylinders`: The Number of Cylinders of the Car.
- `Transmission_Type`: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- `Number_OF_Doors`: The Number of Doors in the Car.
- `Market_Category`: Car Category.
- `Vehicle_Size`: The Size of the Vehicle.
- `highway_mpg`: The Vehicle Higway miles per gallon.
- `city_mpg`: The Vehicle City miles per gallon.
- `Popularity`: The number of times the vehicle was mentioned in Twitter.
- `MRSP`: The price at which the car is sold (target variable).

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: We will start by loading the dataset, exploring its contents, and performing some initial data analysis to gain insights into the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Feature Selection**: We will select the most relevant features for our linear regression model.

5. **Model Building**: Build a linear regression model and regularization.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

7. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to interpret the results and understand the relationship between different features and the predicted car prices.

8. **Using the Model**: Using the Model on a Sample and comparing both predicted and target Prices.

## Running the Code

You can run the analysis by opening the Jupyter Notebook `Car Price Prediction Using Linear_ Regression (ML).ipynb`. Follow the code cells and comments to understand each step of the analysis.

## Results

The results of the linear regression analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations, will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook.
